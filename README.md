# Bank Churn Data - EDA Level 1 Analysis 
This project focuses on performing a Level 1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Bank Churn dataset to understand key customer behaviors and factors associated with attrition.

# Dataset 
The dataset (DS1_C5_S1_BankChurn_Data_Concept.csv) includes customer demographics, account information, and transaction data. The target variable is Attrition_Flag, indicating whether a customer has churned (attrited) or not.

# Project Workflow
  ### Data Loading and Exploration:
  
    1. Load and preview the dataset.
    2. Check for missing values and examine data types.
    3. Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain an initial understanding of the data distribution.

  ### Preprocessing:

    1. Handle missing values if any (e.g., filling missing values with mode or median).
    2. Separate the features into categorical and numerical categories.
    3. Visualize and analyze key features to identify trends and patterns.

  ### Key Analyses:

  ##### Attrition Flag Analysis:
      1. Analyze the distribution of customers based on the Attrition_Flag.
      2. Visualize the data using count plots and pie charts.
  ##### Gender Analysis:
      1. Explore the gender distribution and its relationship with customer attrition.
      2. Use count plots and pie charts for visualization.
  ##### Dependent Count Analysis:
      Examine the number of dependents for each customer and its impact on attrition.
  ##### Transaction Count Analysis:
      1. Analyze the distribution of total transactions by customers.
      2. Use histograms and boxplots to identify outliers and patterns.
  ##### Average Utilization Ratio:
      1. Investigate the Avg_Utilization_Ratio and its significance in predicting customer churn.
      2. Visualize using histograms and boxplots.
    
  # Results:
  
    1. Present findings for each key analysis, highlighting significant patterns.
    2. Discuss any notable observations, such as high churn rates among specific demographics or account behaviors.

# Conclusion 
The Level 1 EDA provided valuable insights into the Bank Churn dataset, highlighting factors such as attrition, gender distribution, dependent count, transaction behavior, and utilization ratio. These preliminary findings serve as a foundation for more advanced analyses or predictive modeling.

This exploratory analysis helps in understanding customer behaviors and can guide future strategies to reduce churn. Future work could involve more in-depth analysis, feature engineering, or predictive modeling to better understand and mitigate customer attrition.
